                <p>Born and raised in Europe, Romania, passionate about IT realm. I like to build things, to
                    test them and even improve them; that's why I work as a tester but I don't run from the dev part of
                    the product life cycle and I love to debug and fix bugs when I discover them.</p>

                <h6>Web developer</h6>
                <p>I was in charge with the UI/UX development process of the web sites. I used HTML, CSS, SASS, PhP with
                    Laravel framework. I learned to setup a project with Docker, XAMPP, Apache. I am familiarized with
                    Git, MySQL. I learned how to deploy the finished product on a server</p>

                <h6>Quality Analysis Tester</h6>
                <p>I worked as a tester and checked every web app before send it to production. Testing shows the
                    presence of defects and implies Validation and Verification in order to check if you're developing
                    the right product and if
                    you're developing the product right.</p>

                <p>There were problems regarding their website, sometimes bugs skipped into production or
                    sometimes the employees were making mistakes because the web app was very complex; I helped by
                    finding the root cause of those issues and fix them.</p>
